//Testing File for Home component. This will have unit testing for Home component

//We might be having any particular utility function that takes two numbers and return us the sum of those numbers

//This takes two numbers and returns a sum
//The testing here means if 2 and 3 are taken as numbers, then does it return 5? If yes then this function is added and is working fine. So, this is just one unit test, this is not the part of UI
function sum(a:number, b:number){
    return a + b;
